# 1 View Plant

## 1.1 Brief Description

This use case allows a user to view detailed information about a plant in their garden. The user navigates to the **List of Plants** for a selected garden and selects a specific plant. The system displays an overview of the plant, divided into two sections:
- **Status**: Displays key information about the plantâ€™s current condition (e.g., growth stage, health).
- **Description**: Provides general information about the plant, such as its type and care instructions.

The user can switch between these sections by clicking on the relevant accordion item.
