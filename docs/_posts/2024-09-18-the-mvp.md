For our MVP we will focus on the software side of our project. We want a functional app that provides our user with a big list of features.
The central hub where the user will spend most of their time will be a garden. This "garden" could be viewed as a folder in a file explorer.
It will not only contain the plants that the user wants to add, but also subfolders (called "spots"). The user can set certain settings in a
spot, like the sunlighting, so the app can give targeted plant suggestions for these spots. The can also suggest a spot to the user, if the
user wants to add a certain plant to their garden. <br/> <br/>

Once a plant is added to a garden, the calendar of the user will be automatically updated with relevant information. The app will add
appointments for the watering, harvesting and sowing of the plant. It will also show the user when a plant is blooming. With this information
the user can plan out a garden into great detail.
