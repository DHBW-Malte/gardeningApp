## Risk Assessment

This week we will tackle the concept of risk management in our blog. If you keep an eye on the risks that could possibly arise during your project, you have the change to mitigate the damage done by these risks. To keep track of the risks we set up a google spreadsheet where we can indentify, describe and rate the risks for our project. Based on a rating of 1 to 3 we determine the probability of, and the potential damage caused by a risk. The product of these two values make up the priority score, which determines in the end the priority level of a risk. If a risk is deemed a high priority it should have our full attention, whereas lower risks should only be kept in mind. Our document calculates the risk level automatically for us, so we don't have to manually put this value in the spreadsheet.

We can sort our risks by different values. We can sort them by priority, category or the person who is responsible for a certain risk. The person who is responsible for a risk makes sure that the mitigation strategies for that risk are followed by the team. This means that the person who is responsible is not necessarily also the person who actively mitigates the risk. To make the risks with the highest priority level immediately recognizable, we colored them with a red color. The spreadsheet is meant as a dynamic document that we can change throughout the development of our project.
