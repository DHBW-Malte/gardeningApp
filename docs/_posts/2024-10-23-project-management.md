# Managing Projects with YouTrack and Scrum Integration

For our latest project, we’ve been using YouTrack for managing tasks and scrumming. Below is a quick walkthrough of how we’ve set everything up and some key features we’ve integrated to keep things running smoothly. We’ve chosen YouTrack to help us manage tasks, track time, and scrum efficiently, thanks to its strong integration with Git and our IDE.

## 1. Syncing Tasks Between IDE and YouTrack

We’ve integrated YouTrack with our IDE, so tasks from our backlog show up right where we code. No need to change between different tools anymore; we can just pull up the task list inside the IDE and keep on slaving forward.

## 2. Creating Issues and Tasks

YouTrack allows us to create, open, and change tasks and issues without even needing to open GitHub ever again. ;) This makes it super convenient to manage everything in one place.

## 3. Git, YouTrack, and IDE Integration

We’ve hooked up YouTrack with our Git repo (using GitHub) and the IDE, so every commit or code push is linked to a task in YouTrack. This keeps everything synced and automated. YouTrack also allows us to track our time spent, which can be easily added to each issue or task, complete with a description of what you’ve done.

## 4. Our Public Scrum Board

We’ve set up our public Scrum board, where everything is laid out with burn-down reports, task assignments, and progress. This makes our process transparent and easy to track.

### 4.1 Burndown Report

Here’s the burndown chart for our first sprint. The chart helps us track how much work remains and whether we’re on pace to finish the sprint on time.

### 4.2 Cumulative Flowchart

We’ve also added a cumulative flowchart that visualizes how tasks move through different stages in the sprint. This gives us a clear picture of how work progresses and ensures nothing gets stuck.

## 5. Wrapping Up

With YouTrack integrated into our development workflow, managing tasks and sprints has become way more efficient. From syncing tasks in the IDE to tracking progress with burndown reports and flowcharts, everything is easier to manage. If you're using YouTrack or a similar tool, we’d love to hear how it’s going for you. Drop your thoughts in the comments!
