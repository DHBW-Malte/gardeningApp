# Managing Projects with YouTrack and Scrum Integration

For our latest project, we’ve been using YouTrack for managing tasks and scrumming. Below is a quick walkthrough of how we’ve set everything up and some key features we’ve integrated to keep things running smoothly.

## 1. Syncing Tasks Between IDE and YouTrack

We’ve integrated YouTrack with our IDE, so tasks from our backlog show up right where we code. No need to change between different tools anymore; we can just pull up the task list inside the IDE and keep on slaving forward.

## 2. Creating issues and tasks

YouTrack allows us to create, open and change tasks and issue without even needing to open Github ever again ;).

## 2. Git, YouTrack, and IDE Integration

We’ve hooked up YouTrack with our Git repo (using GitHub) and the IDE, so every commit or code push is linked to a task in YouTrack. This keeps everything synced and automated. Using YouTrack also allows us to track our time spent and the time spent can easily be added to each issue or task (with a detailed description of what you have done).
