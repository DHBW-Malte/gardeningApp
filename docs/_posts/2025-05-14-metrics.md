## Choosing our metrics

After coding for a while a project becomes ever more complex. It is good practice to go over your code every once in a while and find pieces that need refactoring.
To avoid searching through your code aimlessly to find its weakspots, you can use code metrics that can help you identify code blocks that are in need
of refactoring. For our refactoring we have chosen <strong>code dublication</strong> and <strong>cognitive complexity</strong> as our guiding metrics to find spots in our
code that respectively should be put inside a function (to avoid duplication) and functions that are too complex (based on different aspects such as cyclomatic complexity).
We used SonarCloud (see our dashboard [here](https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=Green-Fingers-App_gardeningApp)) to give us a report of our codebase. Sonarcloud
checks the code everytime we push new commits to the main branch, so it is nicely integrated in our development cycle.

## Refactoring recurring form logic

From Sonarcloud's measurements we were able to locate a code dublication in our login and sign up page. Both pages hold a state for the input given by the user and both pages validate the user input based upon relevant parameters. Before refactoring both pages had the same code for updating the state as shown in the image below.

Figure 1: These lines of code were both present in the sign up and login page.

We extracted this logic and put in a "hook". A hook is basically a function, but contains other react hooks (like useState, which is React's way to store and update a state). In the picture below you can see the custom hook we created to manage the state of a form and also validate the user's input when the state is updated.

Figure 2: The declaration of the useForm hook.

As an extra we also included some strict typing to both the handling of change and the validator to make sure that within the code you are only allowed to use the keys that are given by the initial object you give as a argument to the useForm hook. The hook returns an object that contains the state of the values and errors and a few functions that make it possible to update the state through closure. Now we can just call the useForm hook in both components, and destruct its returned object to make the state management of a form available to the component.

This refactor brought the amount of duplicated lines down by 45.

## Extracting function declaration out of useEffect

Another issue that was brought up by Sonarcload was the declaration of a function within another function, just to call the just declared function in the outer function. This makes the function hard to follow. So we extracted the inner function declaration out of the useEffect. This makes the useEffect funtion easier to read. In the picture below you see the result of the extraction. Only the actual function call remains within the useEffect function.

## Code coverage

For checking the test coverage of our code, we used [codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/DHBW-Malte/gardeningApp). At the moment of writing this blog our tests cover about 60% of our code.
