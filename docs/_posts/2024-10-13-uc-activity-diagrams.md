Hello everyone! We are excited to share our first two activity diagrams for our project. These diagrams illustrate the flow of events for two key use cases in our gardening app "Green Fingers".

## Show Gardens

Our first activity diagram showcases the flow of events for the "Show Gardens" use case. This use case allows users to view an overview of all gardens they have created. By navigating to the garden overview, users can see a list of all their gardens, each with essential information such as the garden name, image, and status.

You can learn more about our Use Case "Show Gardens" [here](https://github.com/DHBW-Malte/gardeningApp/tree/main/docs/usecases/showGardens.md).

## Delete Plant

Our second activity diagram outlines the flow of events for the "Delete Plant" use case. This use case enables users to remove a plant from their gardens. After selecting the garden of the plant they wish to delete, the use can select via the UI the option to delete the plant. The system will then prompt the user for confirmation before permanently removing the plant and its associated data.

We hope you find these activity diagrams informative and engaging. Please let us know if you have any questions or feedback!
