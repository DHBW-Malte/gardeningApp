In Green Fingers, we‚Äôve built a setup that lets each user have their own unique plant collection while still being able to access a general plant catalog for reference.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

Plant Catalog: We have a main catalog that includes basic details about different plants, like their scientific names, water needs, and sunlight requirements. This is for everyone to look up general info on various plants.

Your Personal Plants: You can add plants to your personal list and track specific care information for each one. For example, you can log when you last watered or fertilized each plant and see when it‚Äôs due for care again. This helps you keep your plants happy and healthy.

Gardens: To keep things organized, you can also group your plants into ‚Äúgardens,‚Äù which might represent different areas where you keep them, like ‚ÄúLiving Room‚Äù or ‚ÄúBackyard.‚Äù

This setup makes Green Fingers easy to use for both learning about plants and keeping track of their care, all in one place. Happy gardening! üåø
