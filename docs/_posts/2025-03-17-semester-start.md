## What is our scope for this semester?

Beside improving our UI, we want to add to bigger features.

The first one is the ability to add sensors to a users plants. We want to keep the sensors simple, so we can focus on the connecting of the sensors to the app and sending the measurment through the backend to the app. 

The second features is a calendar for the users to schedule watering, fertilizing etc. . With the calendar we want to try also to add a notification feature to the app.

## What is our tech stack?

For our app we want to stick with React Native, but for our backend and database solution we will switch from Firebase to an SQL Database with a Node.js backend. With these changes we switch from the MVVC architecture to the traditional MVC architecture.
