# Refactoring

**good code isn’t just about making it work — it’s about making it understandable and maintainable**
Martin Fowler

**Refactoring, improving the Design of Existing Code** first chapter walks us through a practical example, refactoring a tangled piece of code for calculating movie rental charges. Inspired by Fowler’s approach, we applied his techniques to refactor a small code for a movie store , and the results were eye-opening. Here’s a quick dive into the process and lessons learned.

As we worked through a small movie rental project, we noticed a lot of duplication and unclear logic. It "worked" — but making any changes felt risky and confusing. Inspired by Fowler’s approach, We decided to refactor the code before adding new features.

Fowler’s key idea is that refactoring means changing the internal structure of the code without changing its external behavior. That’s what We focused on. broke long methods into smaller ones, renamed unclear variables and classes, and used switch expressions (thanks to modern Java) to clean up conditionals.

The result? Cleaner, more readable code.

Refactoring isn’t just something you do when there’s a problem. It’s a mindset.
