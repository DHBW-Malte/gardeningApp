![Retro diagram](https://github.com/DHBW-Malte/gardeningApp/blob/main/docs/assets/screenshots/retro.png)

## What Went Well
- **Motivation & Commitment**: We are all motivated to create a good product, which is keeping us commited to our project. We show up in our meetings and lectures and we are doing the weekly tasks. We don't do the bare minimum for this task, but we try to create real value for our product and ourselves.

- **Skill & Synergy**: As a team, we bring very different skills that help us to take our project to the next level. We also complement each other very well as a team and can share different knowledge.

- **Open Communication**: We try to keep up an open communication, so everyone get heared and we speak about problems and try to tackle them directly. We want to create an environment, where we can give each other constructive feedback.

## What We Can Improve
- **Common Goal**: We as a team have to agree on a common goal, so we are all on the same page. If we found our vision we know where we want to get and how we can get there.

- **Task Delegation**: We need to create more detailed tasks which are leading us to our common goal. They should provide a framework for our sprints, so it is clear what is expected from each of us during this sprint.

- **Meetings Efficency**: Our weekly meetings are lacking in structure, which leads to spending time without making real progress in our project. Also we don't make enough use of the different roles.

## How Do We Want To Improve
- **Common Goal**: Make use of our documentation to create a clear goal and a path. Use our documentation as our guideline, so we can use it like a manual. Connecting each part of our documentation to the code.

- **Task Delegation**: In order be able to delegate our tasks, we first need a detailed path to get to our goal at the end of the semester. We can use this path to plan our sprints with descriptive and detailed tasks, which enables every team member to work proactive on the current sprint goal.

- **Meetings Efficency**: Having a specific goal and agenda for each meeting. But we want give also space for other things. Making use of the scrum-master-role to moderate the meetings. Switching the role between the sprints, to enable any team member to get some experience as a scrum master.
