# Project’s Estimated Use Cases

This week, we're going to show you, dear readers, how we estimate our use cases using Function Points.

As we learned in the lecture, Function Points are a unit of measurement used to calculate the amount of functionality in a software application. In other words, we want to measure how much work we invested in our old use cases to bring them to life. With that data, we can estimate how much effort will be needed to implement the functionality of new use cases in the future.

## How It's Done

We calculate Function Points for our existing use cases, such as the "CRUD User" use case. For example:  
![CRUD user FP calculator](/gardeningApp/assets/screenshots/image.png)
![FP counting weights](/gardeningApp/assets/screenshots/FPtype.png)

Another task was to calculate the time we estimated and the time we spent on each use case using our project management tool—YouTrack, in our case. If you take a look at the table below, you'll see the time per use case:  
![use case time FP](/gardeningApp/assets/screenshots/FP_and_Hours.png)

Now that we have this data, we can plot a graph. Below is the graph of Function Points vs. effort (in hours). We can now visualize how much time we might need for future use cases using these graphs.

![RegressionLine vs FP Hrs](/gardeningApp/assets/screenshots/regression-line.png)

Of course, not every use case will require the same amount of effort or time, but this gives us a solid estimation tool.

Thank you for reading our blog post. We'll stay tuned for your feedback!
