## Tech Stack: App

### Frontend (Mobile Client)
- React Native
We will use React Native to build the mobile application, ensuring a smooth cross-platform experience for both iOS and Android. React Native allows for efficient development while delivering a rich user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) with native performance.

- Expo
The app will be built using Expo, which simplifies development and testing by providing easy access to native features without complex setups. Expo allows us to test the app across different devices seamlessly.

- TypeScript
We will use TypeScript to enhance code quality and maintainability by adding static typing, making the development process more reliable and less error-prone.

### Backend Services:
- Cloud Provider: Firebase serves as the backend infrastructure.
- Database: Firestore is used as a real-time database to store user data, plant catalogs, and garden and plant information.
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication manages user accounts securely.
