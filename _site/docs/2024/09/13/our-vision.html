<h2 id="who-we-are">Who we are?</h2>
<p>We are Sima, Casimir, Ruan &amp; Malte, we love our plants and want to keep them healthy and happy üçÄ. That‚Äôs why we decided to develop an app that supports users in caring for their green friends.</p>

<h2 id="our-vision">Our vision</h2>
<p>The goal is to provide a comprehensive gardening solution that integrates software and hardware tools to manage multiple gardens (both indoors and outdoors).
Automation and smart features like real-time weather updates, UV lighting sensors, moisture tracking, and a solar-powered watering system will assist users in optimizing plant growth.
The system offers information and guidance on various aspects of gardening, such as watering, nutrition, sunlight, harvest timing, and edible parts of plants, while delivering personalized notifications and updates based on plant needs.
It will manage gardens efficiently through hardware components (pumps, tubing, nozzles) and software functionality like plant suggestions based on location, plant calendars, and notifications.
The vision is to make gardening easier, smarter, and more efficient through real-time insights and automation. \ \ 
We invision an app that make the user feel in command of their garden.</p>
